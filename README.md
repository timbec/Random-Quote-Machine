# Random-Quote-Machine
Exercise (Wayline) for Free Code Camp (freecodecamp.com)

Final commit for the Random Quote Machine, an exercise (wayline) designed by FreeCodeCamp. This is a Javascript exercise, for their Basic Front End Development Project section.
In this instance the Random Quote Machine generates quotes from Donald Trump (source: http://thoughtcatalog.com/lorenzo-jensen-iii/2015/07/50-donald-trump-quotes-that-are-so-dumb-theyll-make-your-brain-hurt/). 
Various effects from animate.css are used to display the quotes, organized in an array and randomized so every quote will appear in a different fashion.
The quotes are also tweetable
